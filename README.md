      Equipped with over a decade of experience in software technology, I possess extensive expertise in a broad range of 
      applications, particularly website applications.
      
      Having handled numerous projects from inception to completion, my skills extend beyond software development to 
      include project management, business finance, and computer programming.
      
      My proficiency in Agile/Scrum methodologies has been honed through my hands-on experience with tools like JIRA, Trello, 
      and GitHub.
      
      Additionally, I have noteworthy experience in DevOps engineering, utilizing platforms such as Docker, AWS, and GCP.
      Passionate about leveraging technology to enhance business operations and drive innovations, I firmly believe that 
      itâ€™s never too late to make a positive impact on the world.
      
      I am ready and eager to apply my skills and experiences to new challenges.
